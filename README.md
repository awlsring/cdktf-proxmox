# Terrafrom CDK Proxmox Provider

This is a repo that builds default CDKTF bindings for the awlsring/proxmox provider. It is semi auto-generated from the providers schema using methods pulled from the HashiCorp [cdktf-provider-project](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-project)

This repo and the provider are still in development and should not be used in production.

As this matures, additional custom constructs will be added to this to speed up the creation of VMs and other resources.
